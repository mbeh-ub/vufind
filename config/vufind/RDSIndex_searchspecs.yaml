# Listing of search types and their component parts and weights.
#
# Format is:
#  searchType:
#    # CustomMunge is an optional section to define custom pre-processing of
#    #     user input.  See below for details of munge actions.
#    CustomMunge:
#      MungeName1:
#        - [action1, actionParams]
#        - [action2, actionParams]
#        - [action3, actionParams]
#      MungeName2:
#        - [action1, actionParams]
#    # DismaxFields is optional and defines the fields sent to the Dismax handler
#    #     when we are able to use it.  QueryFields will be used for advanced
#    #     searches that Dismax cannot support.  QueryFields is always used if no
#    #     DismaxFields section is defined.
#    DismaxFields:
#      - field1^boost
#      - field2^boost
#      - field3^boost
#    # DismaxParams is optional and allows you to override default Dismax settings
#    #     (i.e. mm / bf) on a search-by-search basis. Enclose the parameter values
#    #     in quotes for proper behavior. If you want global default values for these
#    #     settings, you can edit the appropriate search handler in
#    #     solr/biblio/conf/solrconfig.xml.
#    DismaxParams:
#      - [param1_name, param1_value]
#      - [param2_name, param2_value]
#      - [param3_name, param3_value]
#    # This optional setting may be used to specify which Dismax handler to use. By
#    #     default, VuFind provides two options: dismax (for the old, standard
#    #     Dismax) and edismax (for Extended Dismax). You can also configure your own
#    #     in solrconfig.xml, but VuFind relies on the name "edismax" to identify an
#    #     Extended Dismax handler. If you omit this setting, the default value from
#    #     the default_dismax_handler setting in the [Index] section of config.ini
#    #     will be used.
#    DismaxHandler: dismax|edismax
#    # QueryFields define the fields we are searching when not using Dismax; VuFind
#    #     detects queries that will not work with Dismax and switches to QueryFields
#    #     as needed.
#    QueryFields:
#      SolrField:
#        - [howToMungeSearchstring, weight]
#        - [differentMunge, weight]
#      DifferentSolrField:
#        - [howToMunge, weight]
#    # The optional FilterQuery section allows you to AND a static query to the
#    #     dynamic query generated using the QueryFields; see JournalTitle below
#    #     for an example.  This is applied whether we use DismaxFields or
#    #     QueryFields.
#    FilterQuery: (optional Lucene filter query)
#    ExactSettings:
#      DismaxFields: ...
#      QueryFields: ...
#    # All the same settings as above, but for exact searches, i.e. search terms
#    #     enclosed in quotes. Allows different fields or weights for exact
#    #     searches. See below for commented-out examples.
#
# ...etc.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Within the QueryFields area, fields are OR'd together, unless they're in an
# anonymous array with a numeric instead of alphanumeric key, in which case the
# first element is a two-value array that tells us what the type (AND or OR) and
# weight of the whole group should be.
#
# So, given:
#
# test:
#   QueryFields:
#     A:
#       - [onephrase, 500]
#       - [and, 200]
#     B:
#       - [and, 100]
#       - [or, 50]
#     # Start an anonymous array to group; first element indicates AND grouping
#     #     and a weight of 50
#     0:
#       0:
#         - AND
#         - 50
#       C:
#         - [onephrase, 200]
#       D:
#         - [onephrase, 300]
#       # Note the "not" attached to the field name as a minus, and the use of ~
#       #     to mean null ("no special weight")
#       -E:
#         - [or, ~]
#     D:
#       - [or, 100]
#
#  ...and the search string
#
#      test "one two"
#
#  ...we'd get
#
#   (A:"test one two"^500 OR
#    A:(test AND "one two")^ 200 OR
#    B:(test AND "one two")^100 OR
#    B:(test OR "one two")^50
#    (
#      C:("test one two")^200 AND
#      D:"test one two"^300 AND
#      -E:(test OR "one two")
#    )^50 OR
#    D:(test OR "one two")^100
#   )
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Munge types are based on the original Solr.php code, and consist of:
#
# onephrase: eliminate all quotes and do it as a single phrase.
#   testing "one two"
#    ...becomes ("testing one two")
#
# and: AND the terms together
#  testing "one two"
#   ...becomes (testing AND "one two")
#
# or: OR the terms together
#  testing "one two"
#   ...becomes (testing OR "one two")
#
# identity: Use the search as-is
#  testing "one two"
#   ...becomes (testing "one two")
#
# Additional Munge types can be defined in the CustomMunge section.  Each array
# entry under CustomMunge defines a new named munge type.  Each array entry under
# the name of the munge type specifies a string manipulation operation.  Operations
# will be applied in the order listed, and different operations take different
# numbers of parameters.
#
# Munge operations:
#
# [append, text] - Append text to the end of the user's search string
# [lowercase] - Convert string to lowercase
# [preg_replace, pattern, replacement] - Perform a regular expression replace
#     using the preg_replace() PHP function.  If you use backreferences in your
#     replacement phrase, be sure to escape dollar signs (i.e. \$1, not $1).
# [uppercase] - Convert string to uppercase
#
# See the CallNumber search below for an example of custom munging in action.
